## Getting Started ⚙️
* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.16
* This will install node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) in you system

* Install Expo CLI on your system. 
    ```
    npm install -g expo-cli

* Once expo is installed run 
    ```
    yarn run 
    ```
* Now the Pixie Dust would Generate some QR Gibberish, install the expo app on your phone while keeping it on same wifi as your machine and scan it. wow This React Native Mobile App will load on your phone ` Aur kya chahiye tumhe zindagi se ?`
